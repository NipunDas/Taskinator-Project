# Authentication

Authentication on this app is accomplished through the bcrypt and JWT npm packages. We use bcrypt to salt and hash passwords,
making them secure to store in our database and verify if somebody is logging in with the correct credentials. Once somebody
does log in, the app accesses protected routes using tokens generated by JWT, which expire after 1 day. The frontend currently
stores the JWT token in state.

These sequence diagrams explain how a user browser session authenticates a user through the signup and login routes:
